# EDA-Automation


Understanding the characteristics of data is crucial before diving into any analysis, especially when dealing with complex events like accidents. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) plays a key role in uncovering patterns, identifying potential issues, and gaining valuable insights from datasets. However, performing manual EDA can be time-consuming and repetitive, especially for large datasets or when dealing with multiple datasets with similar structures.

This project aims to explore the potential of ydata profiling for automating EDA on two historical accident datasets: the Titanic and MH370 incidents. By leveraging ydata profiling, I intend to streamline the analysis process, allowing me to efficiently gain insights into the data and potentially uncover hidden patterns or relationships that might be relevant to understanding these tragic events.

This approach offers several advantages:

Efficiency: Automating repetitive tasks like calculating summary statistics and generating visualizations saves valuable time and allows analysts to focus on deeper interpretation and exploration.
Consistency: Standardized reports ensure consistent analysis across different datasets, facilitating comparisons and reducing the risk of human error.
Reproducibility: The automated process enables the creation of easily reproducible reports, enhancing collaboration and transparency.
By leveraging ydata profiling for automated EDA, I aim to gain deeper insights into the Titanic and MH370 datasets while laying the groundwork for further investigation and potential data-driven approaches to understanding such complex events.

Note: The dataset includes some tweaking to respect privacy and may not present the exact/accurate statistics relative to real life statstics.
